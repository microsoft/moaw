#### Additional tips

- You can also link to any workshop in a publicly available GitHub repository using: `https://aka.ms/ws?src=gh:<github_repo/path_to_file>`<br>
  This way you can adapt the content as you need in your fork and use it directly.

- You can link to a specific section of a workshop, by adding a `step` parameter and an anchor link to the URL: `&step=<section_index>#<heading_id>`

This is useful for sharing prerequisites, notes, etc.

#### Customized catalog view

You can customize the catalog view by adding the following parameters to the URL:

- `sub=<tag_list>`: Filter the catalog by tags (coma-separated). Tags defined in the `sub` parameter will not be displayed nor changeable by the users, and they'll be able to filter using search or additional tags as usual.

- `lang=<language>`: Filter the catalog by language. The language must be a valid [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) 2-letter code. You can also disable the language filter by setting the value to `all`.
