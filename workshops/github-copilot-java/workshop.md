# Creating a New Sample Spring Boot Application

In this section, we will create a sample Java project for testing GitHub Copilot in subsequent chapters. If you already have an existing Java project, feel free to skip this chapter and use your own project instead.  
  
## Creating a Spring Boot Application

```bash
> mkdir sample; cd sample
> curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
           -d dependencies=web,devtools \
           -d bootVersion=3.3.0 \
           -d type=maven-project \
           -d applicationName=CopilotSample \
           -d packageName=com.microsoft.sample \
           -d groupId=com.microsoft.sample \
           -d artifactId=CopilotSample \
           -d javaVersion=21 (or 17) \ 
           -o my-project.zip
> unzip my-project.zip
```

After unzipping the file, you will see the following directory structure:  

```bash

## 4.1 Checking if GitHub Copilot is Activated

The `GitHub Copilot Status Menu` icon is located at the bottom right of VS Code.  

![GitHub Copilot Status menu icon](assets/github-copilot-icon.png)

By clicking on this icon, you can check the status of GitHub Copilot. 
If it displays `Status: Ready` as shown below, GitHub Copilot is ready for use.  

![GitHub Copilot Enabled confirmation](assets/github-copilot-status.png)

If it does not display `Ready`, please return to the [Install Environment](/workshop/github-copilot-java/?step=1#install-extension-pack-for-github-copilot-tools-pack) section and set up your environment.  

## 4.2 Basic Operations of GitHub Copilot

Here is a basic guide on how to use GitHub Copilot. It's not just about enabling the features of GitHub Copilot. By executing shortcut commands during program implementation, or changing the content of your comments, you can modify the suggested code. So, please try out these basic operations of GitHub Copilot yourself.  

### 4.2.1 Code Suggestions and Explicit Triggers

Please open the `HelloRestController.java` file that you created in the previous chapter in your editor. There, by pressing the `Tab` key or entering a newline character, GitHub Copilot will start to suggest code for you.  

![First Trigger of GitHub Copilot](assets/github-copilot-first-trigger.png)

Alternatively, you can explicitly trigger it. If code suggestions are not being made, please enter the following shortcut key. This will execute the `editor.action.inlineSuggest.trigger` command and display the code that GitHub Copilot recommends.  

| OS      | Trigger Inline Suggestion |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| macOS   | `Option (âŒ¥) or Alt + \`   |
| Windows | `Alt + \`                 |

<div class="warning" data-title="warning">

> GitHub Copilot generates code predictions based on the environment it is being used in, so the content displayed may vary depending on the environment.

</div>

### 4.2.2 Accepting Code Suggestions

When a code suggestion is displayed, you can confirm it by pressing the `Tab` key.

If you do not want to accept all the suggestions that Copilot displays and only wish to adopt parts of it, you can do so by pressing the `Command(Ctrl) + Right Arrow` key instead of the `Tab` key. This allows you to adopt suggestions word by word.

| OS      | Determin the proposal   |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| macOS   | `Command + right arrow` |
| Windows | `Ctrl + right arrow`    |

### 4.2.3 Displaying Alternate Suggestions (Functionality may slightly vary depending on the environment)

There may be instances where the source code suggestions given by GitHub Copilot do not match the code you want to implement. In such cases, you can also display alternative suggestions for the initial code displayed. To show alternate suggestions, please press the following shortcut key.  

| OS      | See next suggestion     | See previous suggestion |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| macOS   | `Option (âŒ¥) or Alt + ]` | `Option (âŒ¥) or Alt + [` |
| Windows | `Alt + \`               | `Alt + [`               |

When you press the shortcut key, it will be displayed as follows.

![Alternative Code 1](assets/github-copilot-altenative-code-1.png)

If you press the shortcut key again, a different code will be output from the one above.

![Alternative Code 2](assets/github-copilot-altenative-code-2.png)

### 4.2.4 Displaying List of Alternate Suggestions (Functionality may slightly vary depending on the environment)

Furthermore, if you are using Visual Studio Code, pressing the following shortcut key will display up to 10 alternative suggestions.  

| OS             | Next 10 suggestion |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| macOS, Windows | `Ctrl + Enter`     |

![Alternative Code 3](assets/github-copilot-altenative-lists.png)

As shown above, not only by simply enabling the GitHub Copilot feature, but also by executing shortcut commands during program implementation, you can display and apply a list of alternative candidates. By all means, please learn the basic operations of GitHub Copilot and give it a try.  

## 4.3 Using GitHub Copilot in Java Application Development

### 4.3.1 Points where GitHub Copilot can be used during Java application development

You can use GitHub Copilot in various scenarios during the development of Java applications.

- Creating source code
- Creating Markdown/HTML documents
- Editing Java property files

#### Creating Source Code  

As demonstrated in the basic operations above, GitHub Copilot provides various hints during the implementation of source code. If you use Visual Studio Code, you can further enhance your development productivity by utilizing GitHub Copilot Chat.  

#### Creating Markdown/HTML Documents

When creating documents for your project, you'll likely write them in Markdown. GitHub Copilot can also assist in creating Markdown documents. Open a Markdown file, click on the GitHub Copilot Status Menu icon, and select `Enable Completion for markdown`.

![Enable Completion for Markdown](assets/github-copilot-enable-completion-for-markdown.png)

Once enabled, it will provide various hints while you're writing your Markdown document. 
For example, if you input `#`, it will prompt you to enter a string following the `#`, and it can even predict what to write next based on the context of your document.  

![Enable Completion for Markdown 2](assets/github-copilot-enable-completion-for-markdown-2.png)

You can also use GitHub Copilot when writing HTML documents.  

#### Editing Java Property Files  

Additionally, GitHub Copilot can be used when editing Java property files. Properties are set according to the libraries you use, but it can be challenging to remember all the properties. In such cases, when you enter the property keyword, GitHub Copilot will display possible property candidates for you.  

![Enable Completion for Java Properties](assets/github-copilot-for-java-properties.png)

## Using GitHub Copilot in Java Source Code Implementation

Let's look at a few specific ways to utilize GitHub Copilot when editing Java source code.  

### 4.4.1 Creating Sample Dummy Data  

When implementing a program, you may need to create sample data and test it locally. 
In such cases, GitHub Copilot can help you create sample data easily. For example, if you want to create sample data for stock ticker symbols, GitHub Copilot can generate a list of sample stock symbols for you.  

```text
// Create 20 sample data of Stock Tickers in List<String>  
```

The list of stock symbols created by GitHub Copilot looks like the following.

![Java Coding Sample 1](assets/java-implementation-sample1.png)

Similarly, if you want to create sample data for male names, GitHub Copilot can generate a list of sample male names for you.  

```text
// Create 20 sample data of American men's names in List<String>  
```

The list of name of male by GitHub Copilot looks like the following.

![Java Coding Sample 2](assets/java-implementation-sample2.png)

### 4.4.2 Implementing Check Methods and Utility Methods  

Furthermore, GitHub Copilot can be used in various places during the implementation of a Java program. For example, you might implement check methods or utility methods in Java. In such cases, by writing comments, GitHub Copilot will propose the code for you.  

#### Checking the Format of Email Addresses 

For instance, when implementing a method to determine whether the format of an email address is correct, you would write a comment as shown below.  

```text
/**
 * Determine whether the string specified as an argument is  
 * in the format of a valid email address
 *
 * @param email
 * @return true if the string is a valid email address, false otherwise
*/
```

The actual outputted code looks like the following.  

![Java Coding Sample 3](assets/java-implementation-sample3.png)

The above regular expression `^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$` is used to validate the format of a typical email address. However, it does not cover some specific cases:  

1. The last part of the domain name (TLD, Top Level Domain) is limited to a range of 2 to 4 characters. However, nowadays there are TLDs with more than 4 characters, such as .info, .museum.  
2. The username part does not allow special characters (for example + or =). However, these characters are allowed in some email systems.  

Validating a complete email address is very complex, and regular expressions according to RFC 5322 can be very long and complex. However, for common cases, you can use the simplified regular expression below. If you modify the following code, it allows any alphabetic character of 2 or more characters (e.g. .museum). Also, dot (.) notation is allowed in the username part.  

```java
String emailRegex = "^[\\w-]+(\\.[\\w-]+)*@[\\w-]+(\\.[\\w-]+)*(\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})$";
Pattern pat = Pattern.compile(emailRegex);
return email != null && pat.matcher(email).matches();
```

<div class="warning" data-title="warning">

> The code proposed by GitHub Copilot is not always correct. The output code may need to be modified. Please understand the output code and make corrections as necessary.  

</div>

#### Leap Year Determination Check  

Next, we will implement a method for checking leap year determination. Please write a comment as shown below:  

```text
/**
 * Determine whether the specified year in the argument is a leap year
 *
 * @param year
 * @return true if the year is a leap year, false otherwise  
*/
```

When you write a comment, the code will be output as shown below.

![Java Coding Sample 4](assets/java-implementation-sample4.png)

Of course, with the above code, you can determine a `leap year`, but by using the switch expression added in Java 14, you can implement it more concisely. To write using the switch expression added in Java 14, modify the comment as shown below.  

```text
/**
* Determine whether the year specified by the argument is a leap year  
* The implementation will use the switch expression introduced in Java 14  
*
* @param year
* @return true if the string is leap year, false otherwise
*/
```

![Java Coding Sample 5](assets/java-implementation-sample5.png)

<div class="info" data-title="info">

> The code output will change depending on the comments you write. In some cases, code using older Java language specifications or old libraries may be used. In such cases, by specifically instructing the code you want to write, it will be output as instructed.  

</div>

#### Display Files and Directories Under the Specified Directory  

Next, we will implement a method to display the files and directories that exist under the directory specified in the argument. Write a comment as shown below:  

```text
//Show all files and directories recursively under the directory specified by the argument  
 ```

Then, a code like the one below will be suggested.

![Modernize Java Coding Style 2](assets/modernize-java-code-sample2.png)

The above code will work without any problems, but using Java NIO.2 or Stream API allows for a more concise description. To write according to the new language specification, let's modify the comments. Write a comment as shown below.  

```text
/**
 * In accordance with the Java 17 language specifications, 
 * using features like NIO.2, Stream API, Files.walk,
 * to recursively show the files and directories 
 * that exist under the specified directory.  
 *
 * @param directoryName
 */
````

As a result, a modern code like the one below has been output.  

![Modernize Java Coding Style 1](assets/modernize-java-code-sample1.png)

<div class="info" data-title="info">

> Just like the Leap Year calculation mentioned above, rewriting the comments will prompt it to suggest code using new language specifications or new libraries.

</div>

## 5.3 Code generation

GitHub Copilot Chat can generate code for you.

### 5.3.1 Create CRUD Operation for Spring Boot Application  

When creating a web application, you might need to create an application that performs CRUD operations. This requires implementing the web frontend, backend processing, and configuring property files. In such cases, if you enter a comment like the one below into GitHub Copilot Chat, it will suggest an implementation for a CRUD application.  

```text
> Create a sample application that performs CRUD operations to manage  
  people (name, id, e-mail, address) in Spring Boot.  
  The data should be persisted to the DB, and the database operations  
  should be implemented in Spring Data JPA.  
  The front should be implemented in Thymeleaf.  
  Please show all implementation of classes and methods and  
  application property configuration file.  
```

Then, the code suggested by GitHub Copilot will be displayed.

### 5.5 Code Correction

GitHub Copilot can be used for code modification. For example, in a Java application that was implemented in the past, if there is code that was implemented with an old language specification version, you can modify that code to match the latest language specifications.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Modify the Code 1](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-modify-the-code-1.png)

For example, enter content like the following into the GitHub Copilot Chat prompt.  

```test
> Follow the latest Java 17 language specification and modify your code  
  to use NIO.2 or the Stream API. Use var to define variables  
```

Then, it will suggest Java code that conforms to the latest language specifications.

![GitHub Copilot Chat Modify the Code 2](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-modify-the-code-2.png)

When you move the mouse cursor to the top of the window with the suggested code, a menu will appear.  

![GitHub Copilot Chat Modify the Code 3](./assets/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-modify-the-code-3.png)

You can perform the following actions:  

- `Copy` : Copy the code to the clipboard  
- `Insert at Cursor [^Enter]` : Insert the code at the cursor position  
- `Insert into New File` : Insert the code into a new file  
- `Run in Terminal` :  Execute the code (This function cannot be used in Java as you cannot directly execute the code)  

By performing the above `Copy` and Paste or `Insert at Cursor [^Enter]`, you can modify the old Java code to be compliant with the latest language specifications.
